## CLIENT INSTALL
so navigate to [qbittorrent.org](https://www.qbittorrent.org/download.php) and click mirror link: 64-bit installer install and there you go you have your client installed

## VPN INSTALL
so there is alot of vpn's that are trustable but we will go with Nordvpn cuz its trustable, they dont log your activity and it encryptes your data (as any vpn would) 

so head over to [nordvpn.com](https://nordvpn.com/download/?utm_expid=.pItdvYrBRVOAWVzhTTA4mA.0&utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F) click install for windows and follow the installation process, open nordvpn it should ask for an account as i am a nice guy i will provide 3 accounts than connect to the vpn

 accout number 1 = connellybrian47@gmail.com:generals47
 
 account number 2 = skyknight191@gmail.com:yeahrite
 
 account number 3 = reidkankel3@gmail.com:bubblebuX12@   

## PIRACY SITES + GUIDE
So there is alot of sites (fitgirl, rargb, skidrow(i think they are safe) 1337x masq and more) but today we will focus on 1337x as it host alot of things such as fitgirl repacks and other safe vendors so go over to 1337x.to and search what you want and i would suggest clicking the first one or the one with the most seeders and you wanna click "magnet download" and it should prompt to open your qbittorrent a torrent client you wanna allow it to open it than you want to chose where you want to choose the download directory now just let it finish downloading.

## SEEDING AND WHY YOU SHOULD
Now alot of newbies to piracy wont know what seeding is and why its so praised in the community so torrents are used instead of the file being downloaded from 1 source when someone releases a torrent when it is done downloading it will now rely and you who has the file as a person to help share that file via p2p (peer 2 peer) this is how corparations cant get rid of torrents as they would have to find and delete everyone who had that torrent file's stuff so if a torrent has no seeders you cannot download that torrent as there is no file because no one is hosting that file anymore, the more seeders there are the faster a torrent will be (to a certain extent).

## SUMMARY
So you always want your vpn to be on while you enter the piracy webstite while you are downloading the file and while you are seeding once you are done you can get rid of the file on your torrent client and turn off your vpn.

## SIDE NOTE
Yeah most people here probably know how to pirate but i was bored and to help the cause because i havent been in the piracy scene for a while so yeah DIMITRI OUTSIE.
